## **ONLINE-RAILWAY-RESERVATION**

A fully functional project based on Online Railway Reservation System Project which uses PHP Language with MySQL Database.

The following PHP project contains all the essential features which can be in use by second-year IT students for their college projects. It has a number of features that will allow users to manage online ticket bookings. This web application’s concept is all clear. It’s the same as real-life scenarios and well-implemented on it.


## **Admin Panel**
An admin has full control over the system. He/she can manage passengers, trains, accounting, and so on. Here, each and every section has its own respective details such as name, and other important details.

## **Train Ticket Management**

Moreover, the tickets section is divided into three categories, Pending, Approved, and Management. As mentioned earlier, all the confirmed payments from the passenger’s ticket reservation are stored here for the admin’s approval. Here, the administrator can view a list of pending tickets with details such as the name of the passenger with his/her booking details.

This particular section ties directly to the accounting section for the calculation of total ticket sales. After approval from the admin, the details are forwarded to the approved tickets section(scriptandtools.com).

The admin can view payment codes from each and every passenger’s ticket reservations. In short, an admin has to mark and confirm the payment manually. Now talking about train ticket management, this section is where the administrator can either update the ticket details or delete the train ticket reservations.
