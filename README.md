## **Train Ticket Management**

Moreover, the tickets section is divided into three categories, Pending, Approved, and Management. As mentioned earlier, all the confirmed payments from the passenger’s ticket reservation are stored here for the admin’s approval. Here, the administrator can view a list of pending tickets with details such as the name of the passenger with his/her booking details.

This particular section ties directly to the accounting section for the calculation of total ticket sales. After approval from the admin, the details are forwarded to the approved tickets section(scriptandtools.com).

The admin can view payment codes from each and every passenger’s ticket reservations. In short, an admin has to mark and confirm the payment manually. Now talking about train ticket management, this section is where the administrator can either update the ticket details or delete the train ticket reservations.
